# ALX Low Level Programming - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of variables, if-else statements, and while loops. Each program focuses on a specific task that involves basic programming concepts and control flow.

## Tasks

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

   This task involves writing a C program that checks if a given number is positive.

2. **The largest number**

   In this task, you'll write a C program to find the largest of three numbers entered by the user.

3. **For the absolute value**

   Create a C program that computes the absolute value of a given integer.

4. **FizzBuzz**

   Implement the FizzBuzz game in C. The program should print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."

5. **Print the last digit**

   Write a C program that prints the last digit of a given number.

6. **Jackpot**

   For this task, you'll create a C program that checks if a lottery ticket number is a jackpot winner. The program will compare a given 6-digit number with a winning combination.

7. **The largest in an array**

   Write a C program to find the largest element in an array of integers.

8. **Reverse array**

   Create a C program to reverse the elements of an array.

9. **Delete the first occurrence**

   Write a C program that deletes the first occurrence of a specific element in an array.

10. **The username**

    In this task, you'll implement a C program that takes a username and password as input and grants access if the username is correct. If the username is incorrect, the program should deny access without asking for the password.

11. **Password**

    Improve the previous program to ask for the password if the username is correct. The program should compare the password given by the user with a pre-defined password and grant access only if the password matches.

12. **Print a square**

    Write a C program that prints a square of '#' characters using nested loops.

13. **Print a triangle**

    Create a C program that prints a right-angled triangle composed of '#' characters.

14. **FizzBuzz++**

    Write a C program that implements the FizzBuzz game but with slightly different rules. In this version, if the number has a 3 in it, it should output "Fizz" even if it's not a multiple of 3. Similarly, if the number has a 5 in it, it should output "Buzz" even if it's not a multiple of 5. If the number has both a 3 and a 5 in it, it should output "FizzBuzz."

15. **Sum of multiples**

    For this task, you'll create a C program that calculates the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and a given number.

16. **Prime numbers**

    Write a C program that checks if a given unsigned integer is a prime number.

17. **Leap year**

    Create a C program that checks if a given year is a leap year.

18. **Password Cracking**

    In this task, you'll implement a C program that performs a rudimentary form of password cracking. The program will try different combinations of passwords to find the correct one.

19. **Rot13**

    Write a C program that encodes a given string using the ROT13 cipher.

20. **Delete at index**

    Create a C program that deletes an element
