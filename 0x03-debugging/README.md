# Debugging Tasks

This repository contains debugging tasks for the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. The tasks involve fixing bugs and errors in C programs to make them work as expected.

## Task 0: Multiple mains

**File:** `0-main.c`

In this task, you need to create a new main file `0-main.c` that tests the `positive_or_negative()` function, which prints whether a given integer is positive, negative, or zero.

## Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

**File:** `1-main.c`

In this task, you need to comment out the part of the code in `1-main.c` that is causing an infinite loop. The program should print a message before the loop, and another message after the loop is avoided.

## Task 2: 0 > 972?

**Files:** `2-main.c`, `2-largest_number.c`

The `2-main.c` file tests the `largest_number()` function, which is expected to find and print the largest number among three integers. However, the current implementation is incorrect. You need to fix the `largest_number()` function in `2-largest_number.c` to make it work correctly.

## Task 3: Leap year

**Files:** `3-main_a.c`, `3-main_b.c`, `3-convert_day.c`, `3-print_remaining_days.c`

This task involves fixing the `print_remaining_days()` function in `3-print_remaining_days.c`. The program takes a date as input and converts it to the day of the year, considering leap years. You need to make sure the function produces the correct output for all valid dates and leap years.
